# Product Overview

Configuration file repository for Venera, a manga/comic reader application that supports multiple content sources.

## Core Capabilities

- **Multi-source Support**: Enables access to 30+ manga/comic websites through pluggable configurations
- **Unified API**: Standardizes data models (comics, chapters, comments) across all sources
- **Flexible Authentication**: Supports login via credentials, webview, cookies, or no auth
- **Rich Features**: Favorites, categories, search, comments, ratings, and image loading configs

## Target Use Cases

- Adding new manga/comic sources to Venera app
- Maintaining existing source configurations as websites change
- Contributing community-driven source integrations

## Value Proposition

Open, extensible architecture allows users to contribute and maintain sources independently. Template-based development reduces barrier to entry for adding new sources.
